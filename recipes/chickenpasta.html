        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This family-favorite angel chicken recipe is full of flavor and easy to make with condensed soup and cream cheese.
            It's special enough to serve when you're entertaining guests. 
            I usually double the recipe so we can have leftovers.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                    Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. 
                    Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine. 
                    Add cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink 
                    in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, 
                    bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. 
                    Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
                    4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Serve chicken and sauce over pasta.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
