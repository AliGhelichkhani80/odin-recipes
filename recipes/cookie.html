                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.

                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together; set aside.

            </li>

            <li>

                    Beat brown sugar, melted butter, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. 
                    Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla until light and creamy; add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined. 
                    Stir in chocolate chips.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>

                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. 
                    Cool on the cookie sheets briefly before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
